containers      |        type      |      use      | o(n)
-------------   | ---------------  | ------------- | ----------
string & vector | seq              | ------------- | add/remove elements in middle is fast. single memory clock for all element. Vector is the default choice to use for searching, random access & memory. cant add items in front.        
forward_list    | seq              | Singly LS     | ----------
list            | seq              | Doubly LS. when add or remove elements more frequently. accessing element is slower than vector   | - defined in \<list> no indexing/subscript. use more mem  to store than lists. lists does not support random access. one memory block per element. more slower tha vector & deque & use more memory but faster in adding / removing items in front provided searching is not involved
deque | seq | similar like vector but elements can be added in front efficiently | - defined in \<deque> more memory blocks with each store elements. similar to vector unlike when no sufficient memory is present then new memory block is formed instead of copy like vector. Its slightly slower than vector but faster to add/remove items in front. 
tree | associative | -------- | operations are very fast. no memory is allocated & released. only one other element is modified. no elements are moved around. finding element is very fast.
set | associative | |- defined in \<set> - unsorted collection of data -  elements consists only key which must be hence no duplicates - sets are stored in order - by default \< operator is used - for efficiency, implemented as tree (red black tree) - elements are const & applying algorithm has restrictions - very fast at accessing arbitary element - insertion & deletion is very - tree has to balanced - eg services allows access to check the usernames & if not in sets then return false - to remove duplicates - eg: read document: distinct words in set
map | associative |- Very fast accessing arbitarty element - insertion & deletion fast but tree should be balanced - very useful for indexed data - also useful to store data for file like json & xml  | - element has pair - key, values - keys needs to be uniques - same key two same values - key is used to locate data - eg map of companies staff: key: emp id; value: name of employee - key acts as index same like hashmap - tree structure - insert & remove like set - c++11 we can initialiser for inserting key value pair - supports transcripting but works differenctly from arrays & vectors - if element does not exist it will create, this overwrite the value
maps c++17 | associative | | - intruduced structured binding - easy to access data structures - declare variables, bind them to compound data structures & types ares deduced by the compiler
multiset & multimap | associative | | - sorted default ascending - similar to set & map except duplicate keys are allowed - does not support subscripting - Problem: it containes many matching elements & keys compared to unqiue keys of maps - as items are sorted all duplicate keys&values will be adjacent to each other - so it can have a iterator range - can be solved by find() & count() - lower_bound(k): returns iter to first element whose key is greater than or equal to k - upper_bound(k): returns iter to first element whose key is greater than k - lower_bound(k), upper_bound(k) defines half open range of iterators to all elements with key k - equal_range(): returns pair with first as lower & second as upper bound
hash_table | associative | | - unordered c++11 - uses hash-table instead of tree like map/set 
unordered (set, multiset, map, multimap) | associative | | - faster - reverse iterator not possible - will slow if hash is used - sorting we can populate into sort container
queue/priority queue | container adapter | - Network data packets waiting CPU - must be processed in sequence - can access only front item but if you want other item access use vector or map - PQ: networking; OS schedulers; out of band communication | - DS where items are stored in order - follow fifo - defined in \<queue> - no support for other containers - PQ: std queue with strictly in arrival order - PS similar to queue - PQ: it orders the items with most priority in the front & least at back - PQ: if two items have equal priorities by default queue doesnt order them by arrival time - PQ implemented using vector or deque - same member functions like queue - push(1,3,5,2) into PQ it will populate PQ as 5,3,2,1 highest -> lowest priority - PQ: Only top() can be accessed - PQ: same order is not quaranteed in same priority instead nested maps 
stack | container adapter | - parsing expressions in compilers - checking unbalanced paranthesis - implementing undo functionality - storing history for back/forward buttons in web browser | - DS which stores items in order in which they are inerted - when new items inserted items are at top - only top is accessible - follows lifo - implemented using deque - interfaces similar to PQ
